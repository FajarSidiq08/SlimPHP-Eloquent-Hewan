# Slim 4 with Eloquent ORM

This project integrates [Slim 4](https://www.slimframework.com/) with the power of [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent) (Illuminate Database) to simplify database interactions.

## Features

- **Slim 4 Framework**: A lightweight, high-performance PHP framework.
- **Eloquent ORM**: Enjoy Laravel's robust ORM for database operations.
- **Effortless Setup**: Simple commands to get started quickly.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   composer run serve
   ```

   Now, your application should be running on `http://localhost:8080` or another available port!

## Usage

With Slim 4 and Eloquent ORM, you can manage your database models and relationships as you would in a Laravel project, without the full Laravel framework. This setup is ideal for microservices, APIs, or smaller applications that require fast, efficient data management.

## Configuration

Update your database & awss3 or digitalocean spaces settings in the `.env` file as needed to connect to your preferred database.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you would like to contribute to the project! All contributions are welcome.

## License

This project is open-source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
